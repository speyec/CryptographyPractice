# Assymetric vs Symmetric
| What I learned from watching a tutorial on how to make a cryptographic algorithm |

--- Asymmetric ---
In order to create the public key and private key, we give them size of 1024 bits and this is also where they are generated. Then we save the public key to public.pem and the private key to private.pem. Loading the private key and public key are relatively simple. 


--- Symmetric ---
